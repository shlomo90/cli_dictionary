# Oxfordlearnersdictionary

* Why make the program?
    * I got sick of searching words in browsers.
    * I use a terminal more than browsers. So. I need this program
      that has a terminal based interface dictionary which connects
      to the oxfordlearners dictionary website.
* How to work?
    * Use "requests" and "BeautifulSoup"
        * "BeautifulSoup" helps web scrapping.
* Who wants to use?
    * Some users working on a terminal more than Web Browsers.
    * Some users who are craving to learn English.
